          <p class="product-name">Pro-RF CDR</p>
          <p class="product-description">The phantom for evaluation of imaging performance of radiographic systems. It
            allows wide-range low-contrast and high-contrastresolution evaluation and sensitometric measurements.
            Available in standard layout plus any custom configuration.</p>

          <p class="product-name">Pro-MAM ACR FF</p>
          <p class="product-description">This ACR accredited Full Field phantom was designed to test the performance of
            a digital mammographic system by evaluating the system's ability to image small structures similar to those
            found clinically: micro-calcifications, fibrous structures in ducts and tumor-like masses.</p>
          <p class="product-description">It is similar to the Pro-MAM ACR phantom, the main difference being the size:
            the FF (Full Field) version is larger and covers the entire image detector, thus eliminating scatter.</p>

          <p class="product-name">Pro-CT MK II</p>
          <p class="product-description">The Pro-CT mk II phantom can be used for carrying out acceptance and constancy
            tests of computed tomography systems according to IEC 61223-3-5 and the AAPM (American Association of
            Physicists in Medicine) guidelines.</p>
          <p class="product-description">This phantom consists of several test modules placed inside a cylindrical
            container that can be mounted either directly on a holder of the CT table or on an adjustable stand. It
            allows accurate alignment for measurements on and off the table.</p>

          <p class="product-description">The phantom for evaluating performance of positron emission tomographs (PET).
            Recommended for use in the evaluation of reconstructed image quality in whole body PET imaging. For
            simulation of whole-body imaging especially using PET and camera-based coincidence imaging techniques.</p>

          <p class="product-description">ACR accredited Medium MRI phantom for comprehensive evaluation of critical
            imaging parameters of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a time efficient manner. The phantom can be used
            for the measurement of absolute values for calibration purposes. However, its design is optimized for time
            efficient daily quality assurance too. </p>

          <p class="product-name">Pro-RT ED</p>
          <p class="product-description">The Pro-RT ED phantom is used to account for tissue heterogeneity in
            radiotherapy treatment planning. It can be used to define the precise correlation of CT data to the electron
            density of various tissues.</p>
          <p class="product-description">The phantom consists of two nested disks that represent the head and abdomen.
            Nine different tissue equivalent electron density plugs can be positioned at 17 different locations within
            the scan field. Included is a water vial plug that can be filled with any fluid.</p>
