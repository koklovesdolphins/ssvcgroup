Just hosting a simple/minimal website for my dad, who is a distributor for X-ray imaging equipments.

# p.s.
- Not really a passion project as I dont usually work with frontend code. 
- You wont find any best software practices here.
- Just me trying to be useful at home.
- Thought I could help out with domain name, mailboxes, website and IT setup, at the lowest possible cost for what my dad needs.
